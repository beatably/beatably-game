# Beatably — Claude Code Guide

Beatably is a multiplayer music timeline game. Players place songs in chronological order; first to reach the target count wins. React SPA frontend (Netlify) + Node.js/Socket.io backend (Render). Live at https://beatably.app. Native **iOS app** (Swift/SwiftUI, xcodegen) under `ios/` — submitted to the App Store July 2026 (see [ios/APPSTORE_LISTING.md](ios/APPSTORE_LISTING.md)).

> **Biggest recent change:** Spotify's developer policy bans games, so the Spotify **Full Play** (Premium web playback) mode was removed and consumer previews/album art were migrated to **Apple Music** (MusicKit). Spotify now only powers admin-side song sourcing. See "Audio migration" below.

## Local Development

```bash
# Backend (port 3001) — run first
cd backend && npm install && npm start

# Frontend (port 5173) — separate terminal
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Create `backend/.env` before starting:
```
NODE_ENV=development
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_id           # admin-side song sourcing only (search); no user OAuth
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
FRONTEND_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5173
ADMIN_PASSWORD=anything
# Apple Music (MusicKit) — powers consumer preview URLs + album art (see appleMusic.js)
APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID=your_team_id
APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID=your_musickit_key_id
APPLE_MUSIC_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
```

**Audio migration (July 2026):** Spotify's developer policy prohibits games, so consumer-facing
30s previews + album art now come from **Apple Music** (`applePreviewUrl`/`appleAlbumArt` per song,
via the admin enrichment endpoint). Spotify is **admin-side only** (song search/curation via client
credentials — no user OAuth, no Full Play/Web Playback SDK; all of that was removed).

| `frontend/src/config.js` | API URL: dev → `:3001`, prod → `beatably-backend.onrender.com` |
| `frontend/src/contexts/PreviewModeContext.jsx` | Preview playback context (30s Apple Music clips — the only audio mode) |

## Architecture Highlights

- **Real-time**: Socket.io WebSockets; game state persisted to `cache/state.json` every 250ms
- **Production disk**: Render persistent disk mounts at `/var/data/cache/` (not `cache/`)
- **Game phases**: `setup → player-turn → song-guess → challenge-window → challenge → challenge-resolved → reveal → game-over`
- **Audio**: 30s Apple Music preview clips only (Full Play/Spotify Premium removed July 2026); Spotify is admin-side sourcing only
- **Song DB genres**: includes `'soundtrack'` (TV/movie themes) — gameplay integration not yet wired up

---

## Gotchas

- **CurvedTimeline is tap-based**, not drag-and-drop — despite `react-dnd` being in the dependencies
- **Full Play removed (July 2026)**: the Spotify Premium web-playback subsystem (Web Playback SDK, `/me/player` control, device discovery, OAuth `/login`+`/callback`) was deleted. Preview playback is the only audio mode; `PreviewModeContext.isPreviewMode` is always true. Don't reintroduce Spotify user-auth.
- **Unused packages**: `@radix-ui/react-slider`, `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `lucide-react`
