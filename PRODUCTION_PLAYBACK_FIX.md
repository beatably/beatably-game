# Production Playback Issue Fix

## Problem Analysis

Based on the symptoms described:
- Play button doesn't change to pause icon
- Progress shows old/stale time from previous Spotify usage
- Temporarily resets to 0 but jumps back to old progress
- Device switching works but playback doesn't start

This indicates a **Spotify Web API state synchronization issue** where:
1. The API calls are succeeding but not affecting the active device
2. The playback state is stale/cached from previous sessions
3. The device isn't properly receiving the play commands

## Root Cause

The issue is likely caused by:
1. **Device Transfer Race Condition**: Commands sent before device is fully active
2. **Stale Playback Context**: Previous Spotify session state interfering
3. **Missing Device Activation**: Device not properly activated before play commands

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Device Activation
```javascript
// Force device activation before any playback commands
await spotifyAuth.transferPlayback(deviceId, false);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Wait for activation
```

### 2. Clear Stale Context
```javascript
// Clear any existing playback context before starting new track
await spotifyAuth.pausePlayback();
await spotifyAuth.seekToPosition(deviceId, 0);
```

### 3. Verified Playback Start
```javascript
// Use verified start with longer delays for production
const success = await spotifyAuth.verifiedStartPlayback(
  deviceId, 
  trackUri, 
  0, 
  { 
    pauseFirst: true,
    transferFirst: true,
    maxVerifyAttempts: 5,
    verifyDelayMs: 500,
    forcePositionReset: true
  }
);
```

## Testing Steps

1. Copy `production-playback-debug.js` to browser console
2. Run `debugPlayback()` to diagnose the issue
3. Run `testPlayback()` to test the fix
4. Check `window.lastDiagnosisResults` for detailed logs

## Expected Results

After fix:
- Play button should change to pause icon immediately
- Progress should start from 0 and count up
- No jumping back to old progress times
- Playback should start within 2-3 seconds of clicking play
