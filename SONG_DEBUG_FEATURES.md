## How to Use for Debugging

### Problem: Same songs repeating
1. Open debug panel during game (`Ctrl+D` or click üêõ button)
2. Go to "Current Game Songs" tab
3. Check if songs are actually different or if there are duplicates
4. Look at song metadata to see genre/year distribution

### Problem: Settings not working (genres, years, etc.)
1. In waiting room, open "Game Settings"
2. Scroll down to "Song Debug Panel"
3. Click "Test Current Settings" to fetch songs with current filters
4. Check the metadata to verify:
   - Genres match your selection
   - Years are within your specified range
   - Markets are correct

### Problem: Too many songs from one album
1. Use the debug panel to view current game songs
2. Look for patterns in artist names and years
3. Check the "All Games" tab for song statistics
4. Review genre distribution and popularity stats

### Problem: Difficulty settings not working
1. Test different difficulty settings in Game Settings debug panel
2. Compare the "After Filtering" count vs "Total Found"
3. Check popularity scores of returned songs:
   - Easy: Should have popularity ‚â• 70
   - Normal: Should have popularity ‚â• 50
   - Hard: All songs included

## Console Logging

Enable detailed console logging by opening browser developer tools:
- **Chrome/Edge**: F12 ‚Üí Console tab
- **Firefox**: F12 ‚Üí Console tab
- **Safari**: Cmd+Option+I ‚Üí Console tab

Look for log entries prefixed with:
- `[Spotify]` - Song fetching and playback
- `[Backend]` - Server-side game logic
- `[App]` - Frontend game state

## Temporary Feature

These debug features are intended for development and testing. Once the song selection issues are resolved, they can be:
- Hidden behind a developer flag
- Removed entirely
- Kept as admin-only features
