## Frontend

### Entry Point & Views

`App.jsx` is the master orchestrator (~2,800 lines). It manages socket connections, auth state, and renders one of three views:

| View | Component | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `landing` | `Landing.jsx` | Spotify OAuth login, create/join game |
| `waiting` | `WaitingRoom.jsx` | Pre-game lobby, player list, settings |
| `game` | (inline in App.jsx) | Active game: timeline, footer controls, header |

### Game Phases

Within the `game` view, state progresses through these phases:
- `setup` — Initial load
- `player-turn` — Active player places a card on the timeline
- `reveal` — Card placement is revealed and scored
- `game-over` — Final scores, winner display

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `App.jsx` | Socket management, auth flow, view routing, all game logic handlers |
| `GameFooter.jsx` | Playback controls, song info display, challenge/credit UI (~1,730 lines) |
| `CurvedTimeline.jsx` | Timeline visualization with drag-and-drop card placement (~1,200 lines) |
| `GameSettings.jsx` | Settings panel: difficulty, year range, genres, device selection |
| `SpotifyPlayer.jsx` | Spotify Web Playback SDK initialization and player events |
| `PlayerHeader.jsx` | Player name, score, turn indicator |
| `TimelineBoard.jsx` | Game board rendering |
| `DeviceSwitchModal.jsx` | Spotify Connect device switcher |
| `WinnerView.jsx` | End-of-game screen |
| `SongGuessModal.jsx` | Song title/artist guessing interface |
| `SessionRestore.jsx` | Re-join after page refresh |
| `SongDebugPanel.jsx` | Debug panel (Ctrl+D or bug icon); intentionally kept for development |

### Utilities (`src/utils/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `spotifyAuth.js` | Spotify token management, API requests, device management (664 lines) |
| `productionPlaybackFix.js` | "Nuclear reset" for stuck playback state |
| `deviceDiscovery.js` | Discover Spotify Connect devices via backend |
| `deviceAwarePlayback.js` | Device-specific playback handling |
| `soundUtils.js` | Web Audio API sound effects with HTML audio fallback |
| `sessionManager.js` | Persist/restore game session to localStorage |
| `viewportUtils.js` | Responsive viewport utilities |
| `debugLogger.js` | Intercept console logs and send to backend (enable via localStorage flag) |
| `castUtils.js` | Chromecast/AirPlay casting utilities |

### Audio Modes

**Preview Mode** (default — no Spotify account needed)
- Plays 30-second Spotify preview URLs
- Uses a `<video>` element for AirPlay compatibility on iOS/Safari
- Managed by `PreviewModeContext.jsx`

**Full Play Mode** (requires Spotify Premium)
- Uses the Spotify Web Playback SDK
- Initialized in `SpotifyPlayer.jsx`
- Full track playback via device transfer

### State Management

- React state in `App.jsx` (no Redux/Zustand)
- `PreviewModeContext` — audio mode shared across components
- `sessionManager` — localStorage persistence for reconnection

### Dependencies

```json
react, react-dom              19.x  — Core
socket.io-client              4.8   — Real-time
react-dnd, react-dnd-html5-backend  16  — Drag and drop
canvas-confetti               1.9   — Winner celebration
@radix-ui/react-label, /slot  —     — Accessible UI primitives
class-variance-authority       —     — Button variant composition
clsx, tailwind-merge           —     — Class utilities
tailwindcss-animate            —     — Animations
```

### Known Dead Code / Cleanup Candidates

- **`src/lib/spotify/PlayerSync.ts`** — "Spotify Sync v2" gated behind `VITE_SPOTIFY_SYNC_V2=true`, which is never set. This entire module (~17KB) is currently inactive. Knip confirms its types are unused.
- **`src/components/ui/switch.tsx`** — Installed from Shadcn but never used.
- **`@radix-ui/react-slider`, `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `lucide-react`** — npm packages installed but unused (knip confirmed).

## Backend

### Structure

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.js` | Main server: all HTTP routes, Socket.io events, game state (~5,300 lines) |
| `config.js` | Feature flags, thresholds, provider URLs |
| `curatedDb.js` | File-backed song database (JSON on disk) |
| `analytics.js` | Session and error analytics |
| `songEnrichment.js` | Pipeline: MusicBrainz metadata + preview URLs + geography |
| `geographyDetection.js` | Artist origin detection (MusicBrainz + Spotify genre hints) |
| `musicbrainz.js` | MusicBrainz API integration with rate limiting + local cache |
| `chartProvider.js` | Chart data provider: Billboard Hot 100 (remote GitHub JSON) + Swedish chart history (local JSON) |
| `discovery.js` | Local network device discovery (mDNS/Bonjour + SSDP) |

### Game State

- All game state lives in-memory (`lobbies`, `games` objects)
- Persisted to `cache/state.json` every 250ms (debounced) and on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Restored from disk on server restart
- Production persistent disk: `/var/data/cache/` (Render); falls back to `backend/cache/`

### Song Database

- File: `cache/curated-songs.json`
- Songs are enriched with: Spotify preview URL, MusicBrainz year, genre tags, `isInternational` flag
- Smart migration between deployed DB and persistent disk (avoids overwriting newer data)
- Admin API for managing songs (requires `x-admin-secret` header)
- Swedish chart history: `backend/data/swedish-charts.json` (~4,400 tracks, 1977–present) committed to repo

### Feature Flags (`config.js`)

| Flag | Env Var | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Chart mode (Billboard) | `CHART_MODE_ENABLE` | `false` |
| MusicBrainz enrichment | `MUSICBRAINZ_ENABLE` | `true` |
| Remaster filter | `REMASTER_FILTER_ENABLE` | `true` |
| Swedish chart data path | `SWEDISH_CHART_DATA_PATH` | `backend/data/swedish-charts.json` |
| Swedish Spotify playlist | `SWEDISH_SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID` | `37i9dQZEVXbLoATJ81JYXz` (Sweden Top 50) |

### HTTP API Routes

**Auth**
- `GET /login` — Spotify OAuth redirect
- `GET /callback` — OAuth callback, returns token to frontend

**Songs / Game**
- `POST /api/curated/select` — Select songs for a session
- `POST /api/fetch-songs` — Fetch songs with filters (year, genre, difficulty)

**Devices**
- `GET /api/local-devices` — Discover Spotify Connect devices on LAN
- `GET /api/local-devices/stream` — SSE stream for device updates
- `POST /api/wake-device` — Wake a Spotify device

**Admin** (require `x-admin-secret` header)
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/curated-songs` — Database CRUD
- `POST /api/admin/curated-songs/enrich/:id` — Enrich one song
- `GET /api/admin/analytics` — Analytics overview
- `POST /api/admin/import/preview` + `/commit` — Bulk import
- `GET /api/admin/usage-stats`, `/game-sessions`, `/error-logs`

**Debug**
- `GET /api/debug/songs`, `/games`, `/games/:code/songs`
- `POST/GET/DELETE /api/debug/frontend-logs`
- `GET /api/feature-flags`
